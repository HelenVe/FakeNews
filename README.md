# FakeNews

I got the dataset(train.csv, test.csv, submit.csv) and the LSTM and GRU architectures from here: 

https://www.kaggle.com/jsvishnuj/fakenews-detection-using-lstm-neural-network/data

I have a main folder called FakeNews with all the .py files
Also inside FakeNews, there is a folder named Kaggle where train.csv, test.csv, submit.csv are stored.


Also train_data.csv and test_data.csv which are generated from DataPreprocess.py are stored there.
